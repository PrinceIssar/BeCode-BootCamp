# Title: Querying data

- Repository: `NA`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning challenge`
- Duration: `3 days`
- Deployment strategy : `NA`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Learning objectives
- Able to lookup information about sql on the web
- Able to query a complicated database schema and answer data questions

## The mission

This [basic MySQL tutorial](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/basic-mysql-tutorial.aspx) explains some basic SQL statements. If this is the first time you have used a relational database management system, this tutorial gives you everything you need to know to work with MySQL such as querying data, updating data, managing databases, and creating tables.

After reviewing all the sections mentioned below you can go to a Google Form your coach has prepared for you. 
There you will be asked to provide answers to certain select queries based on the sample database. 
There is no time limit, so don't be afraid to look into the documentation again during the quiz!

Good luck!

### Interesting sections to dive into
I already made a selection of all interesting and common used ways of reading data out MySQL.
With the knowledge you will gain here, you will be able to answer all questions below!

1. Querying data
    - [SELECT – show you how to use simple SELECT statement to query the data from a single table.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-select-statement-query-data.aspx)

1. Sorting data
    - [ORDER BY – show you how to sort the result set using ORDER BY clause. The custom sort order with the FIELD function will be also covered.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-order-by/)

1. Filtering data
    - [WHERE – learn how to use the WHERE clause to filter rows based on specified conditions.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-where/)
    - [SELECT  DISTINCT – show you how to use the DISTINCT operator in the SELECT statement to eliminate duplicate rows in a result set.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-distinct.aspx)
    - [AND – introduce you to the AND operator to combine Boolean expressions to form a complex condition for filtering data.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-and/)
    - [OR– introduce you to the OR operator and show you how to combine the OR operator with the AND operator to filter data.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-or/)
    - [IN – show you how to use the IN operator in the WHERE clause to determine if a value matches any value in a list or a subquery.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/sql-in.aspx)
    - [BETWEEN – show you how to query data based on a range using BETWEEN operator.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-between)
    - [LIKE  – provide you with technique to query data based on a specific pattern.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-like/)
    - [LIMIT – use LIMIT to constrain the number of rows returned by SELECT statement](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-limit.aspx)
    - [IS NULL – test whether a value is NULL or not by using IS NULL operator.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-is-null/)
    - [Subquery – show you how to nest a query (inner query) within another query (outer query) and use the result of the inner query for the outer query.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-subquery/)
        
1. Joining tables
    - [Table & Column Aliases – introduce you to table and column aliases.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-alias/)
    - [LEFT JOIN – return all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table or null if no matching rows found in the right table.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-left-join.aspx)

1. Grouping data
    - [GROUP BY – show you how to group rows into groups based on columns or expressions.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-group-by.aspx)
    - [HAVING – filter the groups by a specific condition.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-having.aspx)
    
1. Common functions
    - [count() - Return the number of rows in a group, including rows with NULL values.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-count/)
    - [avg() - Return the average of non-NULL values.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-avg/)
    - [sum() - Return the summation of all non-NULL values a set.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sum/)
    - [max() - Return the highest value (maximum) in a set of non-NULL values.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-max-function/)
    - [min() - Return the lowest value (minimum) in a set of non-NULL values.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-min/)
    - [Shows you the how to manipulate date and time data effectively.](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-date/)

## Extra info about the test database
### MSRP
Because our sample database is American it uses the abbreviation MSRP, short for *manufacturer's suggested retail price*.
The manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) is the price that a product's manufacturer recommends it is sold for at point of sale. The MSRP is also referred to as the list price by some retailers.
