# Install Apache-PHP-MySQL on Windows

## All in one (via a tool)

(+) Faster and easier install
(-) Less configurable

[Xamp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) will install everything that's needed to use PHP for us: Apache, PHP and MySQL. (make sure you tick the checkbox for MySQL)
If you're not quite sure what these all are, ask your coach for some documentation.

[Xdebug](https://gist.github.com/odan/1abe76d373a9cbb15bed) is a tool that helps with... debugging.
See the Ubuntu guide for more details.

## Manually

(+) More configurable
(-) A lot of work to install
